H0: the predictor doesn't help to improve model. (I may be wrong).
TV, radio and intercept line have effect in model, while newspaper - hasn't. I don't understand question.
2.
KNN classifier predict class based on K-nearest neighbors (for example, 2 > 1, we choose 1 class). Meanwhile KNN regressor finds values of k-nearest neighbors and find the average of these values. Carefully enough?

a) 
2. after deviding this model on men and women we get Gender(35 - 10GPA). I suppose we can drop 10GPA, because GPA fixed.
3. Wow. If GPA will be high enough, (GPA > 3.5) men will earn more money on average. It changed somehow I don't understand.
b) 137.1
c) overconfindent statement. There is little evidence of a linear interaction effect. But interaction can be x1^2 * sin(x2), for example. Or even nonparametric.
