1. 
H0: the predictor doesn't help to improve model. (I may be wrong). My teacher answered: H0 - true beta coefficient is equal to zero. H1: coefficient has random value.
TV, radio and intercept line have effect in model, while newspaper - hasn't. I don't understand question.

2.
KNN classifier predict class based on K-nearest neighbors (for example, 2 > 1, we choose 1 class). Meanwhile KNN regressor finds values of k-nearest neighbors and find the average of these values. Carefully enough?

a) 
2. after deviding this model on men and women we get Gender(35 - 10GPA). I suppose we can drop 10GPA, because GPA fixed.
3. Wow. If GPA will be high enough, (GPA > 3.5) men will earn more money on average. It changed somehow I don't understand.
b) 137.1
c) overconfindent statement. There is little evidence of a linear interaction effect. But interaction can be x1^2 * sin(x2), for example. Or even nonparametric.

4. a) if there is correlation in irreducible error, cubic regression can catch the pattern and RSS will be quite low. Otherwise, linear regression will have lower RSS.
b) obviously, linear regression will generalize better, test RSS will be lower for linear model.
c) in this case RSS for cubic regression will be lower anyway, I suppose.
d) there is not enough information to tell.

5. aaagggghhhhrrr... it's hard.

6. I made a photo.

7. I solved it.
